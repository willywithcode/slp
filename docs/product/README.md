# Product Docs

This directory contains current consumer-product behavior derived from real
accepted intent. Harness deliberately ships no fake product domains.

When a user provides a product specification, derive smaller living documents
here instead of keeping one growing specification as the operating manual. Name
files after actual product domains, such as `overview.md`, `billing.md`,
`permissions.md`, or `api-conventions.md`.

## Current Product Contract

- [overview.md](overview.md): roles, communication and supervision contract,
  platforms.
- [workflow.md](workflow.md): working with and without spl, step by step,
  with alert runbook, example and troubleshooting.

## Update Rule

When behavior changes:

1. Update the affected product document when the expected behavior changed.
2. Update the active execution plan when complex work uses one.
3. Add a lasting decision only when future work must inherit a consequential
   product, architecture, data, security, compatibility, or validation choice.
4. Add or update executable proof that exercises the behavior.

Bounded changes do not require a parallel lifecycle record.
